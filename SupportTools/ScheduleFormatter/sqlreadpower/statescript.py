#Analysis script 2 for Verdiem data from CalPlug 2014 study
#Print States and Dates for a given user in a PLSim or CSV style format
#This is a simple reformatter for a given subject - it will return DB data for that subject with minute resolution
#Developed by M. Klopfer Aug 30, 2018 - V1

#Operation:  This script is a stand-alone processor that takes the Verdiem data and formats it into a style used as a .CSV input into the PLSin program.  This script will not actually output a .CSV file its current state, just format the text in a way that can be quickly formatted into the specific PLSim format.   
            #The script reads from a database/table with the following entries:  record_id    subject_identifier    desktop_type    MPID    device    status    int_record    date    day_of_week P1  P2...[There are 96 entries that correspond to 15 minute periods across the day]

#Dependencies and setup considerations:  This program uses Miniconda/Eclipse in development and is within an Eclipse workshop - it shares identical dependencies as PLSim:  https://github.com/CalPlug/PlugLoadSimulator-PLSim
#Note, if the console is not large enough in Eclipse to display the return, consider the following:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2600653/adjusting-eclipse-console-size
